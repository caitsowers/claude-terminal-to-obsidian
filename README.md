# Dot

**Dot cleans up text pasted from Claude (terminal) to Obsidian.**

Text copied from Claude running in the terminal often arrives messy: terminal color codes, a shared left margin that Obsidian misreads as a code block, paragraphs that are hard-wrapped into many short lines. Dot fixes all of that automatically on paste, so what lands in your note is clean bullet list.

It runs on every paste, uses the plain-text version of what you copied, and only takes over when it actually changes something.

## What it does

On paste, Dot applies these steps (each can be toggled on or off in settings):

1. **Strip ANSI escapes** — removes terminal color codes, cursor controls, and other escape sequences (e.g. the junk in `\x1b[0;32mtext\x1b[0m`).
2. **Remove shared indentation** — if every line is indented by the same amount, that common left margin is stripped, so indented output is not parsed as a Markdown code block.
3. **Normalize bullet glyphs** — bullet characters at the start of a line (`•`, `◦`, `▪`, `‣`, `●`, `▸`, `►`, and more) become standard Markdown `- `.
4. **Straighten curly quotes** *(off by default)* — converts curly quotes (`“ ” ‘ ’`) to straight ASCII quotes and `…` to `...`.
5. **Reflow hard-wrapped paragraphs** — joins lines that were wrapped to a fixed width back into single flowing paragraphs and list items. Headings, blockquotes, lists, tables, horizontal rules, and fenced code blocks are left intact.
6. **Convert paragraphs to bullets** *(on by default)* — turns each paragraph into a `- ` list item. Great for pasting AI-chat or bulleted content whose bullet markers were lost in the copy. Turn it off if you mostly paste normal prose and want plain paragraphs. See [Bullet-aware pasting](#bullet-aware-pasting).

## Example

Pasting hard-wrapped terminal/AI output like this:

```
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog and keeps running across
  the field until it reaches the far fence at the edge of the meadow.

  A second thought that was wrapped the same way and should also become
  one clean line instead of several short ones.
```

…lands in your note as two tidy bullets (or, with **Convert paragraphs to bullets** turned off, two clean paragraphs).

## Bullet-aware pasting

When **Convert paragraphs to bullets** is on, Dot is aware of where your cursor is:

- **On an empty line** — each pasted paragraph becomes its own top-level bullet, with no blank gaps between them.
- **Inside an existing bullet** — the first paragraph continues that bullet (no stray `- `), and the rest become sibling bullets.
- **Inside an indented (sub-)bullet** — the whole paste stays at that indentation level, matching the depth and indent style (tabs or spaces) of the bullet you are in.

## Settings

Open **Settings → Community plugins → Dot** (gear icon). Each step above has its own toggle.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Strip ANSI escapes | On | Remove terminal escape sequences and stray control characters |
| Remove shared indentation | On | Strip a common left margin from all lines |
| Normalize bullet glyphs | On | Replace bullet characters with `- ` |
| Straighten curly quotes | Off | Curly quotes → ASCII, `…` → `...` |
| Reflow hard-wrapped paragraphs | On | Join wrapped lines into single paragraphs/list items |
| Convert paragraphs to bullets | On | Turn each paragraph into a `- ` list item |

**Convert paragraphs to bullets** is on by default, so a paste becomes a tidy bullet list. Turn it off when you are pasting normal prose and want plain paragraphs instead.

## Notes

- Dot works from the **plain-text** version of the clipboard, so pasting formatted (rich) text will drop bold/italic in favor of clean text.
- If a cleaned paste is ever not what you wanted, just press `Cmd/Ctrl + Z` to undo back to the raw text.
- No build step: the plugin is plain CommonJS loaded directly as `main.js`. No network access, no telemetry, no data leaves your vault.

## Installation

### From the Community Plugins browser (once approved)

Settings → Community plugins → Browse → search for **Dot** → Install → Enable.

### Manual

1. Download `manifest.json` and `main.js` from the [latest release](https://github.com/caitsowers/dot-paste-cleaner/releases/latest).
2. Create a folder `dot-paste-cleaner` inside your vault’s `.obsidian/plugins/` directory.
3. Put both files in that folder.
4. Restart Obsidian, then enable **Dot** under Settings → Community plugins.

### Via BRAT (for beta/early installs)

Use the [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) plugin and add this repository: `caitsowers/dot-paste-cleaner`.
